What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created. This file must
contain the files that run the version control procedures.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is just your container of files related to your project.
The repository is a container of files that are being monitored for changes.
You may not need all of your files to be monitored for changes. Monitoring all
files might slow down your computer or network. The separation of the
repository from the working directory is required for efficiency.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created. This file must
contain the files that run the version control procedures.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is just your container of files related to your project.
The repository is a container of files that are being monitored for changes.
You may not need all of your files to be monitored for changes. Monitoring all
files might slow down your computer or network. The separation of the
repository from the working directory is required for efficiency.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can compare the changes to the working directory with the last file in the
staged area before you commit. If you made significant changes since you added
the file to the staging area, you can commit the file in the staging area
before continuing work on the file in the working directory.

What are some situations when braches would be helpful in keeping history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are useful for experimentation. An example of experimetation might be
multiple people working on the same problem independently. Branches allow
people to make changes to the program without affecting other people's work.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams allow you to see how the computer structures the commits.

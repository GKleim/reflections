When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your
work local?

Using a remote repository should be sued when you are collaborating on a
project with many people. Using a remote repository may also be useful for
saving your project in case your computer crashes.

Why might you want yo always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?

You do not want Git automatically pull changes from your repo because you may
not want all commits from other users on your computer.

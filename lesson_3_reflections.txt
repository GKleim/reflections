When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your
work local?

Using a remote repository should be sued when you are collaborating on a
project with many people. Using a remote repository may also be useful for
saving your project in case your computer crashes.

Why might you want yo always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?

You do not want Git automatically pull changes from your repo because you may
not want all commits from other users on your computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Clone is when you make a copy of repository on your local machine either of
either a local repo or a repo on GitHub. Fork is when you copy a repository
from someones GitHub profile to your GitHub profile. Branch is when you create
a new path in your current repository.

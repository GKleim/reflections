When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your
work local?

Using a remote repository should be sued when you are collaborating on a
project with many people. Using a remote repository may also be useful for
saving your project in case your computer crashes.

Why might you want yo always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?

You do not want Git automatically pull changes from your repo because you may
not want all commits from other users on your computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Clone is when you make a copy of repository on your local machine either of
either a local repo or a repo on GitHub. Fork is when you copy a repository
from someones GitHub profile to your GitHub profile. Branch is when you create
a new path in your current repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The remote could be the master file for a project. Your goal might be to create
a new feature for that project that does not break anything unrelated to your
new feature. You may want to be able to reference the original file that you
will eventully need to merge back into after your working copy becomes filled
with new code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

You would have to collaborate by sharing your computer screens or sending files
through email. Sharing by email has a smaller learning curve than Git and
GitHub. It would be harder to track all changes logically and simply with just
sending files through email.
